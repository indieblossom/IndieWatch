<p>Hey guys! It's Max here and this is basically a blog of my IndieWatch and progress on designs and software and functionality.
If you have any questions, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:indieblossom@gmail.com">indieblossom@gmail.com</a> and I will get back to you.</p>

<a id="another-smartwatch-really-why" class="anchor" href="#another-smartwatch-really-why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ANOTHER SmartWatch? Really? Why?</h3>

<p>There is no real good answer to this question. Best I can come up with is "because it is my own." I want my OWN watch that I can make MYSELF and design, MYSELF, because it is my watch, and I dished out the money for it. That is my problem with lots of things now-a-days. Everything is closed source and for profit, instead of making a cool invention and wanting to share it. That is another reason for this. I want to share my ideas and let people do what they please with them.</p>

<p>By all means, copy my designs, parts and code. Please. I won't bite ;) Open source is one of my favorite things in the world, well, besides cars!</p>

<p>What can I do to make it better? What am I doing wrong? I want your input!!</p>

<p>Join the stand and OPENSOURCE it!</p>
