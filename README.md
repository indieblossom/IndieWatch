# IndieWatch
What more could a guy want than a smart watch, made specifically made FOR YOU!

This is a project started by Max Haywood, mjkliou(man), first started in April of 2015. I got inspiration from numerous smartwatches made by other people on hackaday.io and other web forums, so I started on my own!
Take that Apple!
