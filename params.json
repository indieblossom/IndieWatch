{"name":"Indiewatch","tagline":"What more could a guy want than a smart watch, made specifically made FOR YOU!","body":"###Welcome!\r\nHey guys! It's Max here and this is basically a blog of my IndieWatch and progress on designs and software and functionality.\r\nIf you have any questions, shoot me an email at indieblossom@gmail.com and I will get back to you.\r\n\r\n###ANOTHER SmartWatch? Really? Why?\r\nThere is no real good answer to this question. Best I can come up with is \"because it is my own.\" I want my OWN watch that I can make MYSELF and design, MYSELF, because it is my watch, and I dished out the money for it. That is my problem with lots of things now-a-days. Everything is closed source and for profit, instead of making a cool invention and wanting to share it. That is another reason for this. I want to share my ideas and let people do what they please with them.\r\n\r\nBy all means, copy my designs, parts and code. Please. I won't bite ;) Open source is one of my favorite things in the world, well, besides cars!\r\n\r\n###Anyways, this is YOUR watch, along with MINE and I want YOUR input!\r\nWhat can I do to make it better? What am I doing wrong? I want your input!!\r\n\r\nJoin the stand and OPENSOURCE it!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
